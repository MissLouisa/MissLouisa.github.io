        <p>Super Mario Bros is a super popular game developed by Nintendo. It was a game far above the time and consequently it has a lot of repercussions.
           Besides being well done it still had an affordable price.</p>

        <p>The successor to the 1983 arcade game, Mario Bros., it was released in Japan in 1985 for the Famicom, and in North America and
           Europe for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Players control Mario, or his brother Luigi
           in the multiplayer mode, as they travel the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue the Princess from Bowser. </p>

        <p>They must traverse side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.</p>

        <p>The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka and they took three years to create mechanics of the game and finish the entire programming development.
           The design of the first level, World 1-1, serves as a tutorial for first-time video gamers on the basic mechanics of platform gameplay. The aggressively size-optimized
           profile was intended as a farewell to the Famicom's cartridge medium in favor of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System, whose floppy disks temporarily became the dominant
           distribution medium for a few years.</p>

        <p>Super Mario Bros is frequently cited as one of the greatest games of all time, with praise on its precise controls. It is one of the bestselling games of all time as well,
           with more than 40 million physical copies. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the 1983 crash, and helped
           popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. Koji Kondo's soundtrack is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music into a centerpiece of game
           design. The game inspired an expansive franchise including a long-running game series, an animated television series, and a feature film. Re-releases and cameos of the game
           are on most of Nintendo's following systems. Alongside Mario himself, Super Mario Bros has become prominent in popular culture.</p>

        <p>Mario inspired people! People created emulators in any plataform, they did reverse engineering to add more things in the game or to make them more personal, also they used
        Artificial Intelligence to get the better way to win the game.</p>

        <p>Here is a video about Mario Super World with Artificial Intelligence: </p><a id="mario-video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44" target="Mario and AI"><button id="special"class="button">VIDEO</button></a>

        <p>The game consists of eight worlds with four sub-levels called "stages" in each world.
           The final stage of each world takes place in a castle where Bowser is fought above a
           suspension bridge; the first seven of these Bowsers are "false Bowsers" whom are actually
           minions disguised as him, whilst the real Bowser is found in the 8th world. </p>

        <p>Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge,
           although they can also be defeated using a Fire Flower. The game also includes some stages taking place underwater,
           which contain a lot and different enemies. In addition, there are bonuses and secret areas in the game (Thanks, God!).
           Most secret areas contain more coins for Mario to collect, but some contain "warp pipes" that allow Mario to advance
           directly to later worlds in the game without completing the intervening stages. And, until nowadays people use these tricks.</p>

        <p>After completing the game once, the player is rewarded with the ability to replay the game with changes made to increase its difficulty,
           such as all Goombas in the game being replaced with Buzzy Beetles, enemies similar to Koopa Troopas
           who cannot be defeated using the Fire Flower.</p>

            <p>Mario is in everywhere! You can find every kind of stuff about Mario.</p>

            <p>The success of Super Mario Bros. led to the development of many successors in the Super Mario series
               of video games, which in turn form the core of the greater Mario franchise. Two of these sequels, Super
               Mario Bros 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3, were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES,
               experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled Super Mario Bros 2,
               was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere
               as a part of Super Mario All-Stars under the name Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. The gameplay concepts
               and elements established in Super Mario Bros are prevalent in nearly every Super Mario game. The series consists
               of over 15 entries; at least one Super Mario game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. Super Mario 64,
               an entry in the series and the first to take place in a three-dimensional environment, is widely considered one of the greatest
               games ever made, and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D.

            <p>Super Mario Bros has served as inspiration for several fangames. In 2009, developer SwingSwing released Tuper Tario Tros, a game which combines elements of Super Mario Bros. with Tetris. Super Mario Bros Crossover, a PC fangame developed by Jay Pavlina and released in 2010 as a free browser-based game, is a full recreation of Super Mario Bros. that allows the player to alternatively control various other characters from Nintendo games, including Mega Man, Link from The Legend of Zelda, Samus from Metroid, and Simon Belmont from Castlevania. Mari0, released in December 2012, combines elements of the game with that of Portal (2007) by giving Mario a portal-making gun with which to teleport through the level, and Full Screen Mario (2013) adds a level editor.In 2015, game designer Josh Millard released Ennuigi, a metafictional fangame with commentary on the original game which relates to Luigi's inability to come to terms with the game's overall lack of narrative.</p>
