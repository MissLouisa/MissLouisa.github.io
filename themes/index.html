    <h1>Mother 3 or Earthbound</h1>
    <p>
        It's a traditional two-dimensional RPG game composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives experience points for victories. If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase.
