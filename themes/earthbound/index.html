            <p>Lucas (Japanese: リュカ Lucas) is the main protagonist of Mother 3. He is from Tazmily Village and he is out of the seven main characters in total (Lucas, Kumatora, Duster, Boney, Claus, Flint, and Salsa). He usually uses sticks and baseball bats as his primary weapons, along with his signature PK Love power, which grants him the ability to pull the Seven Needles to awaken the Dark Dragon sleeping underneath the Nowhere Islands.</p>
            <p>This little boy is playable in the Prologue as a tutorial character. In the tutorial, Lucas learns how to dash, and is taught how to fight in a battle against the Mole Cricket.</p> 
            <p>In Chapter 1, Claus, Lucas, and Hinawa fail to return to Tazmily Village from Alec's house. This causes the village to organize a search party to look for them. After Flint and Duster's fight against the Reconstructed Caribou, Claus and Lucas are found. However, Lucas is quiet, and only murmurs something about the "forest coming to life, and taking them". After Flint learns of Hinawa's death, he loses his grip and Claus and Lucas have their eyes covered by Tessie to not let them see what's happening. He attends Hinawa's funeral, where Lucas reveals that Claus went to fight the Drago that killed their mom in order to avenge her. He stays at Flint's house until the third chapter.</p>

            <p>At the end of Chapter 3, Lucas comes to assist Salsa, Kumatora, and Wess when they are cornered by Fassad. He brings Drago Jr. and his mother, apparently wanting to avenge their cyberized family member.</p>

            <p>At the start of Chapter 4, he becomes the permanent main character.</p>
