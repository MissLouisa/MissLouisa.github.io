        <p>Kirby was created by video game designer Masahiro Sakurai as the player character of the 1992 game Kirby's Dream Land.
           The character's design was intended to serve as placeholder graphics for the game's original protagonist in early
           development and thus was given a simplistic ball-like appearance.</p>

        <p>Kirby hails from the distant Planet Popstar, where he lives in a dome-shaped house in the country of Dream Land.
           He has a positive attitude, and frequently helps to save Dream Land through the use of his unique powers.
           His age is never directly stated, although he is referred to as a "little boy" in the English manual for Kirby's Dream Land,
           described as a baby in the anime, and was referred to as being a "jolly fellow" in Kirby Super Star.</p>

        <p>Kirby's main ability is inhaling enemies and objects and spitting them out with incredible force. Both his mouth and body expand
           to allow him to inhale things much larger than himself. However, there is a limit to what he can inhale; excessively large or heavy
           foes like bosses can resist Kirby's inhale. Against these opponents Kirby must find smaller objects to use as ammo or intercept his
           opponent's attacks and send them back at them.</p>

        <p>Since he first appeared in Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby has received positive reception. Nintendo Power listed Kirby as their 19th favourite hero,
           commenting that he doesn't get the respect that he deserves. Kirby ranked second on GameDaily's Top 10 Super Smash Bros characters list. They also
           included him in their "Pretty in Pink Video Game Characters" article. GamesRadar listed Kirby as one of the most lovable blobs, calling him one of
           the cutest things to appear in a Nintendo game, yet also describing the way he defeats his enemies as "horrific." He ranked sixth on IGN's top 10
           veteran Super Smash Bros characters, described as the "pinkest badass ever made." An issue of the webcomic VG Cats depicts Kirby in 100 forms from
           both video games and other forms of media, such as characters from The Legend of Zelda, Metal Gear and Gundam.In 2011, Cheat Code Central ranked
           Ninja Kirby as the ninth top ninja in video games.</p>

        <p>UGO Networks listed Kirby on their list of "The Cutest Video Game Characters" stating "It's easy to get on board with someone who will eat anything".</p>

        <p>The Classic series has not reached a definite conclusion. Originally developed for the NES, the original Mega Man series experienced graphical
           improvements in fourth and fifth generation installments. The series had no games developed for sixth generation consoles but returned in the seventh
           generation purposely sporting graphics, sound and gameplay similar to the original NES games to inspire a nostalgic look and feel, distributed as downloadable
           content instead of retail games like the previous installments.</p>
